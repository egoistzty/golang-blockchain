# golang-blockchain
This is a toy implementation of blockchain system in golang.
And we mainly refer to the [program](https://github.com/tensor-programming/golang-blockchain.git) of tensor-programming.

We also upgrage some out-of-date parts of the original one as follows:
1. The original program is based on the BadgerDB of version 1.5.4, while in our program a brand new [version] (github.com/dgraph-io/badger/v3 v3.2103.2) has been applied.
Consequently, some usages of functions are also upgraded based on the new version. 
To be continued...
